Tanin Vahy is the first dramatic spoken translation of the Holy Quran, awarded the title of "Servant of the Quran" by the President in 2023 (1402). In "Tanin Vahy," the fluent translation of the Holy Quran is presented for the first time in a spoken-dramatic form. All verses are recited with appropriate emotion, and wherever a role or dialogue appears in the verse, actors have performed it dramatically, creating an audio translation accompanied by suitable ambiance and diverse sound effects to help the meaning of the divine words resonate more deeply with the audience.
